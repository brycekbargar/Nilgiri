# Nilgiri
Chai style assertions for .NET  
*nilgiri is some sort of black tea but it was the only one that started with 'n'...*

### To "Build" ###
I hate how .NET shoves all the packages in a global folder...  
`dnu restore --packages packages`

I'm still working out the `DNVM` thing.

### To Test ###
`dnx . test`
